# Systematic Literature Review nach Grames et al. 2019

## 1. Naive search
  - a. Identify research question.
    -   **How are algorithmic profiling tools used in PES affecting the directly involved stakeholders (caseworkers and job seekers) within the job placement process?**
  
  - b. Identify the concept groups.
    -   PICOC: **P**opulation, **I**ntervention, **C**omparison, **O**utcome, **C**ontext
  
  - c. Use prior knowledge, or consult colleagues or experts in the field to generate an initial list of search terms that fit the concept groups (PICOC): the naive search should be as relevant to the topic as possible; when choosing terms for the naive search, think both laterally (choose synonyms) and vertically (different levels of the terms).
    -   We applied the pearl-growing method to select relevant keywords for the naive search. We identified three articles as *pearls*. Starting from those articles, we used backward and forward searching through citations.
    -   The resulting keywords (note that we did not define any keywords for the Comparison and Outcome concept groups):
    ```{r, echo=F}
knitr::kable(keywordgroups)
``` 
  
  - d. Combine the concept groups into a search string.
    -   The resulting search string for the naive search is: **(street-level bureaucra\* OR caseworker\* OR unemploy\* OR jobseeker\*) AND (profiling OR algorithmic profiling OR classification of jobseekers OR algorithmic tool\* OR algorithmic decision-making OR automated decision-making OR street-level algorithm\* OR data work OR artificial intelligence OR ai) AND (public employment services OR public services)**
  
  - e. Assess how discrete the search is and modify it as needed: "(...) if you get more than 700 for a narrowly defined question or more than 1500 for a broader question, you are not being precise enough and the keywords that `litsearchr` identifies will not be as relevant because the keyword co-occurrence network will be diluted by irrelevant studies".
    -   There is no need to search all databases for the naive search (I exported results from *Web of Science* and *EBSCO* as suggested by Jessica Daikeler who also worked on a SLR with this package)
    -   Naive search using the above string yielded the following results (as of December 6, 2023; note that these are **unfiltered** for source type and year):
        -   Web of Science: **513 results**
        -   EBSCO: **2,629 results**

## 2. Importing results and removing duplicates
```{r}
search_directory <- "/Users/dariaszafran/Desktop/SLR/References_231206/"

# Importing all references; the function automatically creates a data frame containing the references from both databases
naiveimport <- litsearchr::import_results(directory = search_directory, verbose = T)

# Removing duplicates; there were 246 duplicates
naiveresults <- litsearchr::remove_duplicates(naiveimport, field = "title", method = "string_osa")
```

## 3. Identifying potential keywords
```{r}
# Identifying keywords based on a function that approximates the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm
rakekeywords <- litsearchr::extract_terms(text = paste(naiveresults$title, naiveresults$abstract),
                                          method = "fakerake",
                                          min_freq = 2, # only get keywords that appear at least twice in the full set of results
                                          ngrams = T,
                                          min_n = 2, # get keywords that consist of at least two words
                                          language = "English")

# Identifying keywords based on database tagged keywords
taggedkeywords <- litsearchr::extract_terms(keywords = naiveresults$keywords,
                                            method = "tagged",
                                            min_freq = 2,
                                            ngrams = T,
                                            min_n = 2,
                                            language = "English")
```

## 4. Building the keyword co-occurrence network
```{r, echo=F, include=F}
all_keywords <- unique(append(taggedkeywords, rakekeywords))

naivedfm <- litsearchr::create_dfm(elements = paste(naiveresults$title, naiveresults$abstract),
                                   features = all_keywords)

naivegraph <- litsearchr::create_network(search_dfm = naivedfm,
                                        min_studies = 2,
                                        min_occ = 2)
```

## 5. Identifying change points in keyword importance
```{r}
cutoff <- litsearchr::find_cutoff(naivegraph,
                                  method = "cumulative",
                                  percent = .80,
                                  imp_method = "strength")

reduced_graph <- litsearchr::reduce_graph(naivegraph, cutoff_strength = cutoff[1])

searchterms <- as.data.frame(litsearchr::get_keywords(reduced_graph))

head(searchterms, 20)
```

## 6. Grouping terms into concepts
```{r}
# Exporting the potential keywords so that they can be grouped manually in Excel
rio::export(searchterms, "searchterms_231208.xlsx")

searchterms <- readxl::read_xlsx("/Users/dariaszafran/Desktop/SLR/searchterms_231208.xlsx")
write.table(searchterms$`litsearchr::get_keywords(reduced_graph)`, file = "searchterms_slr", sep = " ", row.names = F, quote = F)




broad_science_df <- as.data.frame(broad_science)
write.table(broad_science_df$broad_science, file = "stopwords_slr", sep = " ", row.names = F, quote = F)
```
